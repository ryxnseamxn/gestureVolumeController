I like computers, and I like when they can see, so I went ahead and used cv2 and mediapipe to create a gesture based volume controller

When you run the program (on mac lol) you can pinch and expand your index finger and thumb to control your system's volume

I used cv2 to handle all of the computer vision and osasript to change the system volume by interpolating the distance between my fingers to the value I want for the system volume.
